##LifeHack 2021 README

**Theme / problem statement:**

1. Social
In a post-COVID-19 world where face-to-face interaction is no longer the main mode of communication, how would you revolutionize making new and/or maintaining relationships?
2. Education
As technology rapidly infiltrates the education sector and changes not just the way people learn, but also how people teach, what refreshing ideas do you have to make learning/teaching more safe, exciting, and effective?

**User Stories**

1. As a student, I would want to be able to summarise paragraphs in an instant so that I will be able to make notes more efficiently.
2. As a student, I would like to be able to share my summarised notes with my course-mates, especially if it can be entertaining.
3. As a student, I would like to have a creative and fun learning tool that will make learning more enjoyable and less rigid
4. As an educator, I would like to create more engaging videos about the content taught so I can spice up my lessons in order to engage my students better. 

**Our Hack:**

Our proposed hack, MediaTE, encompasses both the social and education theme of this event. MediaTE is a platform that allows users to:

1. Convert a plain wall of text into a dialogue voiced by their favourite characters.
2. Distil the essence of tedious paragraphs in an instant.
3. Better still, we could even summarise paragraphs and turn them into entertaining dialogues voiced by anyone under the sun.
